          <p>{% blocktrans %}Let's go through an explanation step by step:{% endblocktrans %}</p>
          <h6>{% blocktrans %}1 - If you can properly understand how something works, one thing you can do is modify it.{% endblocktrans %}</h6>
          <p>
            {% blocktrans %}Anything that can be modified, can be used to better suit your needs while maintaining a high level of balance between you, other people and the general environment.{% endblocktrans %}
          </p><p>
            {% blocktrans %}In order to achieve this, you should get information regarding how your biological and psychological machinery works, how your social interactions function and the dynamics of your environment.{% endblocktrans %}
          </p><p>
            {% blocktrans %}Those abilities can empower you to revise and redesign your values and your culture.{% endblocktrans %}
          </p><p>
            {% blocktrans %}This is the first change we encourage people to make.{% endblocktrans %}
          </p><p>
            {% blocktrans %}But you will face limitations regarding the tangible world around you.{% endblocktrans %}
          </p><p>
            {% blocktrans %}In other words: You changed yourself, but not the tangible things that are around you.{% endblocktrans %} 
          </p>
          <h6>{% blocktrans %}2 - That is why after you go through all the courses, you get access to detailed information on how you can change the world around you. This is centered (but not limited) to your home.{% endblocktrans %}</h6>
          <p>
            {% blocktrans %}You will be able to know how to produce your own food, water and electricity, among other things.{% endblocktrans %}
          </p><p>
            {% blocktrans %}These solutions are broken down in various tiers, so people who have no resources can recycle materials and generate the proposed solutions.{% endblocktrans %}
          </p><p>
            {% blocktrans %}People who have enough resources also will have knowledge on how to buy or modify and implement ready-to-use solutions to attend their demands.{% endblocktrans %}
          </p><p>
            {% blocktrans %}All solutions works in various scales (for instance, they work on small apartments and big houses) and are automation oriented.{% endblocktrans %} 
          </p>
          <h6>{% blocktrans %}3 - But why you should only focus on yourself when we know the world needs such solutions?{% endblocktrans %}</h6>
          <p>
            {% blocktrans %}Because it is very difficult for one person to change more than what they can control. The easiest possible path to improve the world is for each individual to control and modify themselves and where they live.{% endblocktrans %}
          </p><p>
            {% blocktrans %}Also, even if you agree with everything stated here, you should not try to directly convince anyone. For reasons too complex to explain here, this way of changing people simply doesn't work.{% endblocktrans %}
          </p><p>
            {% blocktrans %}People change when they see the benefits of change and can measure, analyze and relate to those changes.{% endblocktrans %}
          </p><p>
            {% blocktrans %}For example:{% endblocktrans %}
          </p><p>
            {% blocktrans %}If you can save money on food, water, electricity and other things, you are improving your life. If you can interact better with the world around you by new and balanced values, you can influence other people, so they can at least be curious about how you are able to live in such a way.{% endblocktrans %}
          </p><p>
            {% blocktrans %}If someone close to you wants those same benefits, you can tell them how you managed to do it and even advise them to go through the same process you did here with us.{% endblocktrans %}
          </p><p>
            {% blocktrans %}Consider that you positively influenced someone to undergo the EDU process.{% endblocktrans %}
          </p><p>
            {% blocktrans %}Now, there are two people that changed and aligned behaviours and their own environment to improve the way they live.{% endblocktrans %}
          </p><p>
            {% blocktrans %}Extrapolating this to a critical mass scale, if your neighbours undergo the same understanding, you can work cooperatively and change the environment you all share. For example, a building could have a vertical automated farm with solar and wind electricity production that can abundantly provide to all apartments.{% endblocktrans %}
          </p><p>
            {% blocktrans %}Since our platform is free and online, this process can happen simultaneously anywhere in the world.{% endblocktrans %}
          </p><p>
            {% blocktrans %}If we keep the extrapolation of this example, we can eventually make changes that change the entire world.{% endblocktrans %}

          <p>{% blocktrans %}Ok, so let's detail this endeavor even more:{% endblocktrans %}</p>
          <p>
            {% blocktrans %}Performing initiatives of self-improvement and physical implementations, such as housing or even the construction of a city with all these aspects in mind, do not reflect a real transition: it is necessary that the culture and values of a particular individual are aligned with others so the acceptance of immutable facts, limitations of the planet's resources and understanding the impact of distorted social values that has been perpetuated for generations are recognize as well as the human capacity to shape the conditions in which it exists, without extinguishing their cultural expressions or co-opt with something at the expense of their welfare.{% endblocktrans %}
          </p><p>
            {% blocktrans %}Therefore, IDETRA proposition is that all individuals are properly informed about the aspects that surround them and perform in their current values, a behavioral transition. To achieve this goal, a free online education system containing the information necessary for this first stage to be completed will be available. At the end of the educational iteration, the participant is granted access to sets of transactional projects customizable to his reality. Taking into account that it is possible to develop and implement such projects with very few resources, they are designed in a modular way as previously stated.{% endblocktrans %}
          </p>
          <h6>{% blocktrans %}From our standpoint, if you can create automated equipments and perform maintenance of those equipments using waste and recycled materials, any other instance that could be achieved with more resources is easily conceivable.{% endblocktrans %}
          </h6>
          <p>
            {% blocktrans %}Regarding limitations to this approach, technology and planetary capacities are usually under measured. Consider the following illustrative examples:{% endblocktrans %}
          </p>
          <li>
            {% blocktrans %}The human being is able to create a high-tech closed ecosystem and live in a hostile environment such as outer space. (In other words: we have the technology to accomplish extraordinary feats){% endblocktrans %}
          </li>
          <li>
            {% blocktrans %}If it rained gold for two days, all the people would try to gather the maximum amount of such mineral at home. If it continued raining every day for a year, they would create mechanisms to get rid of the nuisance. (In other words: the real problem is not the use of resources but the perception of the current value things around us have. This is intrinsic to any culture){% endblocktrans %}
          </li>
          <li>
            {% blocktrans %}Considering an area the size of Australia (7,692,024 km²) and dividing it by the number of human inhabitants of the planet (round it up to 8 billion people), every baby, child, man, woman and elderly could possess for their own use, an area of 961.50 m², leaving the rest of the world for other things, such as agriculture, recreation, ecosystem not altered by man, etc. (In other words: we have more than enough territorial resources left to implement what is necessary for several generations){% endblocktrans %}
          </li><li>
            {% blocktrans %}In the 1960's, when the United States and the Soviet Union where on a space race, pens that write in zero gravity were developed at a cost of $ 1 million dolars and acquired by NASA so astronauts could write in space missions. The Soviet Union used pencils that could do pretty much the same type of work. Although the real history has more details, including the fact that USSR also purchased such pens later, this example still proves a point. (In other words: you can solve problems and overcome adversity in a highly technological and practical way, with a low commitment of money and very few resources){% endblocktrans %}
          </li>
          <h6>
            {% blocktrans %}We call 'transition' the effort made by every human being to improve themselves and the environment up to a point where the root causes of all our problems are surpassed.{% endblocktrans %}
          </h6>
          <p>
            {% blocktrans %}It is possible to say that to achieve such transition, we have to drastically change our values, the way we behave, how we live and how we relate among ourselves and with the environment. However, these changes are intended not to bring limitations to the welfare, the environment or the human expression of individuality. The plentifulness of resources and to change the governance matrix for a technological model have the characteristics of a necessary complementation to this expected behavioral change.{% endblocktrans %}
          </p><p>
            {% blocktrans %}We understand that if we don't undergo this transition, we will continue on the harmful course of a global detrimental reality we face today. Therefore, we propose starting iterating a new social, economic and cultural model, gradually supplanting the previous one.{% endblocktrans %}

            {% blocktrans %}To facilitate the entire process, all content is framed in a gamified fashion. This way, it is easier for you to go through all the material and makes all the knowledge actionable.{% endblocktrans %}
          </p><p>

          <h6>{% blocktrans %}On a final note,{% endblocktrans %}</h6>
          <p>{% blocktrans %}we would like to state what is the core motivator of this entire endeavour:{% endblocktrans %}
          </p><p>
            {% blocktrans %}Consider that today, modern society has access to highly advanced technology and can make available food, clothing, housing and medical care, upgrade our educational system and develop a limitless supply of renewable and non-polluting goods and services.{% endblocktrans %}
          </p><p>
            {% blocktrans %}Through the provision of a projected efficiently economy, everyone could enjoy a very high standard of living with all the amenities of a highly technological society. Instead of money, we could easily produce all the necessities of life and provide a high standard of living for everyone, unlike an economy based on scarcity (such as capitalism, socialism, communism, marxism, etc.){% endblocktrans %}
          </p><p>
            {% blocktrans %}Our proposal states that the planet's resources cannot be linked to human labor, much less to repetitive work processes that can be easily performed by machines (including machine maintenance){% endblocktrans %}
          </p><p>
            {% blocktrans %}All the resources are held as the common heritage of all the people of planet Earth, in order to transcend over time the need for artificial boundaries that separate people and unifying our civilization. We emphasize that this approach to global governance has nothing in common with the present aims of the elite to form a world government headed by large corporations, with the majority of the global population subject to them. Our vision of globalization encourages all people on the planet to be the best they can, not to live in abject submission to a corporate governance.{% endblocktrans %}
          </p><p>
            {% blocktrans %}This proposal not only contributes to the well-being of people but also provides the resources and information necessary for an individual to participate in any area of competency. Success would be measured by the satisfaction of individual activities, rather than the acquisition of wealth, property and power.{% endblocktrans %}
          </p><p>
            {% blocktrans %}At the moment, we have enough material resources to provide a high standard of living for all inhabitants of the earth. Only when the population exceeds the tolerable capacity of a site is that problems such as greed, crime and violence emerge. To overcome this shortage, most of the crimes and even the prisons of today's society would no longer be necessary. We understand that this is an extremely difficult scenario to envision but these notions are well grounded in studies and experimentations. It would be possible to use technology to overcome shortages, through the application of renewable energy sources, computerization and automation of production, inventory and distribution, design of safe, energy-efficient cities, with advanced transportation systems, providing universal health care and more relevant education, and above all, generating a new incentive system based on human and environmental concern. You can extrapolate that aspect by changing certain behaviors that are considered standard by the current culture or even said instinctual, combined with the use of automated machines to replace the repetitive work and resource management (extraction, production, testing, measurement, distribution and recycling), we already have the ability to live by these precepts, extinguishing inequalities and factors that generate them (competition, monetary system, negotiations archaic as law enforcement, treatment of diseases, rehabilitation of offenders, etc.). Many people believe that today there is a lot of technology in the world, and this technology is the major cause of our environmental pollution. It's not the case. The abuse and misuse of technology that is what should be our main concerns. In a more humane civilization, instead of machines replacing people on a harmful perspective, they would reduce the workday, increase the availability of goods and services, and prolong the rest period. If we use new technologies to complement each and every repetitive work, raising the standard of living of all people, the introduction of technological machines will no longer be any kind of threat.{% endblocktrans %}
          </p><p>
            {% blocktrans %}A world based on such principles would also involve the effort to develop new energy sources, clean, renewable and geothermal, controlled fusion, solar, photovoltaic, wind, wave and tidal. We would finally be able to produce energy in unlimited quantity that could propel civilization for thousands of years. An initiative such as this should also commit to re-design our cities, transportation systems and industrial plants, to be efficient, clean and conveniently meet the needs of all people.{% endblocktrans %}
          </p><p>
            {% blocktrans %}With automated inventory on a global scale, we can maintain a balance between production and distribution. Only nutritious and healthy food would be available and planned obsolescence would be unnecessary and non-existent in such reality. By getting rid of the need for professions based on the monetary system, such as lawyers, bankers, insurance salesmen, marketing and advertising teams, vendors and stockbrokers, a considerable amount of waste will be eliminated. A good amount of energy would also be saved by eliminating the duplication of competitive products such as tools, cutlery, pots, pans and vacuum cleaners. It is good to choose. But instead of hundreds of different manufacturing plants and all the paperwork and personnel required to make similar products, only some of the highest quality would be needed to serve the entire population. Our only shortage is the lack of creative thought and intelligence to do this management for ourselves and criticism limited to the belief in our leaders to solve these and other problems. The most valuable untapped resource today is human ingenuity. With the elimination of debt, fear of losing employment and other ills plaguing our society, we can re-draw our values. Such security in knowing that your needs will always be met, combined with teaching how to relate to the planet and its limitations as well as with other human beings in a much more meaningful way, considerably reduce both mental and physical stress leaving us free to explore and develop our abilities and potential. If the idea of eliminating money bothers you, consider this: If a group of people with gold, diamonds and money was trapped on an island with no resources such as food, clean water and air, such wealth would be irrelevant to their survival. Only when resources are scarce is that money can be used to control the distribution. You can not, for example, sell the air we breathe or the water that flows from the abundant source of a mountain. Although the air and water are valuable when plentiful, they can not be sold. Counterpoint, if it rained gold every day of the year, people would no longer value it as scarce and expensive and would then seek solutions to control the aberrant weather event that is disrupting their lives, generating mechanisms in which gold rain would not negatively influence their daily lives. Money is only important in a society when certain resources for survival must be rationed and the people accept money as medium to exchange scarce resources. Money is a social convention, an agreement, so to speak. It is not a natural resource nor does it represent one. It is not necessary for survival unless we have been conditioned to accept it as such. Politics, beliefs and pseudoscience do not have guidelines for a management system in which human well-being is the driving force of its execution. We propose a model that puts nature and its laws, fauna and flora, together with the human being in the center of the whole purpose of civilization.{% endblocktrans %}
          </p><p>
            {% blocktrans %}For this initiative to work, it is primarily necessary that entrenched concepts of our society are criticized for each individual in their own reality, especially the duality 'what I want' versus 'what I need', where the inexorable conclusion is that a system can produce and supply what you need - when you need it - and unnecessary and cyclical goods and processes can be dramatically reduced, generating plenty of production and distribution.{% endblocktrans %}
          </p><p>
            {% blocktrans %}Thus, inequality is taken out of the human civilization equation. Scientific studies show that societies produce more and develop better their creativity when the population is free and widely attended (sometimes at no cost), and fully embedded with factors related to survival and well-being, excluding socio-economic and cultural distortions that generate most psychosis, prejudices, phobias and current diseases. You must also separate initiatives related to transition to such a civilization from a civilization that lives in such a format. While the transition will need to encompass cultural and human practical differences that despite harmful are still considered 'normal' for the happiness and well being, the generations that are created in a resource-based economy will not know or live these old detrimental concepts and only then will the practice of that today is extrapolated as the best possible future of humanity. In the long term, this project aims to be the core drives from other cities to be replicated and that, consequently, this group of cities take such a proportion that they are no longer needed financial resources (donations, external production, exchange / barter and marketing of surplus production) intrinsically linked to the current state transition to a new technological socio-culture redesign. It is considered also that this transformation can occur in other countries, in parallel or sequentially to the project, which can result in critical mass range of cities in this format on the planet, thus having a real global transition from a scarcity-based reality to a reality based on abundance. This is considered only as a baseline for alignment opportunities and other initiatives.{% endblocktrans %}
